   <p> To go back to the home page: <a href = index.html> go back! </a> </p>
   <p> I am excited to announce that I am offering tutoring opportunities 
    this summer! I am dedicated to helping students 
    achieve their academic goals and build a strong foundation of knowledge. 
    Whether your child needs assistance with specific subjects, homework support,
    or exam preparation, I am here to provide personalized guidance and support.
    I can accommodate various grade levels and 
    subjects, including math (up to AP AB Calculus), science, English, and more. 
    My tutoring sessions are tailored to each student's unique needs, focusing on 
    reinforcing concepts, improving problem-solving skills, and boosting confidence. 
    I strive to create a positive and engaging learning environment where 
    students can ask questions, explore challenging topics, and make progress 
    at their own pace. </p>
